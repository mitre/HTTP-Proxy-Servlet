# Version 2.0 (unreleased)

\#231: Added support of preserveCookiePath configuration parameter. It allows to keep cookie path unchanged in Set-Cookie server response header.

\#237: `jakarta servlet-api` is now supported by default. `javax servlet-api` support is still available via the artifact having the `javax` classifier.

# Version 1.12.1 released on 2021-12-28

\#215: '[' and ']' should be encoded as they are unsafe characters. https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt
Thanks @phuongnq

# Version 1.12 released on 2021-04-03

Java 8 is now the minimum java version the servlet works with.

Servlet API 3.1.0 is now the minimum servlet API supported.

\#158: More extension points RE HttpClient building and cookies.
Thanks Mark Michaelis.

\#176: Flush chunked responses to support Server Sent Events (SSE).
Thanks Matthias Bläsing

\#181: Ensure the configured maximum number of connections can actually be
established in a reverse proxy scenario. Ensure proxy connection is shutdown
when client connection is closed.
Thanks Matthias Bläsing

\#183: Compression handling in the apache http client is disabled by default.
This allows passing through compression methods not supported by apache http
client. It requires though, that compression filters in the servlet container
respect already set `Content-Encoding` headers and don't try to compress the
outputstream again. The old behaviour can be restored by setting the init
parameter `handleCompression` to `true`.
Thanks Matthias Bläsing

\#187: URITemplateProxyServlet should have been URL encoding the template parameter names.
Thanks Daniel Hasler

\#190: Percent encoded question marks in the path should stay encoded.

# Version 1.11 2019-01-12

\#155: Add OSGI manifiest headers.
Thanks Abhishek Jain.

\#153: New settings: http.maxConnections and http.connectionrequest.timeout
Thanks Gotzon Illarramendi.

\#149: Introduced overrideable method rewritePathInfoFromRequest.
Thanks Oren Efraty.

\#151: Copy `HttpOnly` flag of proxy cookie to request clients, for fixing security vulnerabilities in cookies.
This also updates `javax.servlet-api` to `v3.0.1`.

\#150 Setting the read timeout in the `RequestConfig` is not enough.
The read timeout must be set in the `SocketConfig` as well.
Setting the read timeout only in the `RequestConfig` can cause hangs which could
block the whole proxy forever.
Attention: Method signature of `createHttpClient(RequestConfig)` changed to
`createHttpClient()`.
Please override `buildRequestConfig()` and `buildSocketConfig()` to configure the
Apache HttpClient.
Thanks Martin Wegner.

\#139: Use Java system properties for http proxy (and other settings) by default.
This is a regression; it used to work this way in 1.8 and prior.
Thanks Thorsten Möller.

\#132: The proxy was erroneously sometimes appending "?null=" to a
request that had no query portion of the URL.
Thanks @pjunlin.

README updates.  Thanks Bruce Taylor, Gonzalo Fernández-Victorio
